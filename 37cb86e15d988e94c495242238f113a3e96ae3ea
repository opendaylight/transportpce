      "message": "Would suggest to start the consolidation : trib port and trib-slot shall be known by the SH, so that the service-implementation-request will include in the service-end-points some otn-constraints container with the trib-port number and a leaflist containing the opu-trib-slots to be used. Please assume this will be available and correctly set to set them here (see comment on SH/mapping-utils). Assumptions could be the following : same value for A and Z end, provided for A end, default value 1 for both trib port and trib slot if not provided (this is an optional parameter).If imposed, sapi and dapi may also be provided as OTN constraint. Don\u0027t rememeber what we did with the Sapi/dapi change, but this is an opportunity to aso include the sapi/dapi setting. If imposed respect sapi and dapi as provided. If not, apply the setting you proposed in your change with the function providing a hash key.",

      "message": "I guess we should try to set also the odu-service-rate and otu-service-rate if present in the initial OpenROADM compliant service-create, since when you make the builder for the otn-service-path, you assume them to be configured in the service-implementation-request (in service-A/Z end). Would also suggest for A end Z end point to set the trib-port-number and the trib-slot-number, hard-coding both of them to 1 at that time (prefer to see the hard-coding here than in the Renderer Mapping-utils --\u003e in this case don\u0027t need to check in Renderer if information is missing, il will always be there). This should allow to pass the tests, having all information required to build otn-service-path in the meanwhile. \n@christophe.betoule@orange.com; @gilles.thouenon@orange.com;  If you make this, then Christophe and Gilles, handling TRNSPRTPCE-164 \u0026 TRNSPRTPCE-165, will make the modification to set correctly the trib-port and trib slot from information the SH will get from the PCE in the path-description of the service-path-rpc result (Christophe in TRNSPRTPCE-164 will also need to change the path-description grouping of transportpce-path-description.yang, adding a uses transport-pce-common-types:otn-constraint statement, because I forgot to add the information on the trib-port/slot to the path description when I pushed the 1.7 models)",

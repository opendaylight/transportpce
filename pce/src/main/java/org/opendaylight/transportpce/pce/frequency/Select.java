     * Selecting an available frequency range from which a service frequency may be chosen.
     *
     * <p>Selecting a frequency range may depend on multiple factors.
     *
     * <p>A) API input.
     *       This may be viewed as "client wish list". Meaning the client
     *       may wish to restrict picking a frequency range from within a larger
     *       range of the clients choosing. This range may be viewed as the
     *       intersection between the client's range, the available range
     *       and the required range for a service.
     *       The client may also wish to pick a specific range determined
     *       by a central frequency and number of slots. Unlike the precious
     *       example, this range is more of hard requirement. Meaning this range
     *       will have to be a subset of the available range.
     *
     * <p>B) Available frequencies.
     *       Independent of the client wish list there are physical restrictions,
     *       such as the available frequencies on the node(s). This will supersede
     *       the client's wishes.
     *
     * <p>C) Customer restrictions.
     *       Maybe there is a limitation to what frequencies
     *       are available to a certain customer. This may also supersede both
     *       the client wish list and the available frequencies on the nodes.
     *
     * <p>If any of the requirements cannot be met, an empty BitSet should be returned. Meaning there is
     * no frequency range available suiting the given requirements.
     *
     * @param clientRangeWishListIntersectionLimitation Should be treated as the intersection of available frequencies.
     * @param clientRangeWishListSubsetLimitation Should be treated as a subset of available frequencies.
     * @param availableCustomerRange Should be treated as the intersection of available frequencies.
     * @param availableFrequenciesOnNodes The available frequencies on the nodes.

With the Map+List solution here, key uniqueness is guaranteed and we don\u0027t have to deal with potential future guava evolution.\n\nTaht said, this is not a strong objection. I consider this as a minor implementation details issue. So feel free to propose your own solution if you don\u0027t think this is the right approach.\n\nAlso if you want to broaden the debate of Guava dependencies in odlparent, I guess it would be better to raise the point first to odl discuss mailing-list rather the TSC.\nIMO this is more an odlparent maintainer choice than a governance issue. Also Guava dependencies use is probably well justified by other use cases there.",

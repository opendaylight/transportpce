For example LF + \") {\" at the same indentation level than the if-clause first line is pretty common too.\n\nIf I might have no reported it very often in the past, I should have.\nI agree continuous improvement processes can be pretty annoying but it is, or at least shoud be, the norm in in open source and any software development products.\nI am convinced that many difficulties we are facing now are due to the lack of readability in some pieces of code,  especially in the conditions blocks, i.e. more generally to the technical debt and an urge need to refactor some pieces of the current code.\n\nIMO adopting this good habit (to separate clearly condition blocks from the code block body) would really help to avoid such situations in the future.",

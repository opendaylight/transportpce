      "message": "Good to have removed the condition on 50GHZ slotwidth that would avoid to pass through this. However your first assumption that you will need to seperate 2 cases was good. I guess we still need to separate 2 cases : one for the 100G use case using a flexgrid (37.5 GHz), the other where we handle higher rates (200,300, 400G) and where we need to provision a 75 GHz bandwidth. But the criteria to go through one or the other case shall be based on the rate of the channel to be provisioned.",

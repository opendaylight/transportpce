      "message": "I think this commit could use a more descriptive message. How about:\n\n```\nRefine TAPI topology conversion utilities\n\nThis update improves several TAPI topology conversion functions by\ncleaning up logging, removing unused parameters, and replacing hard-coded\nstring literals with TAPI constants.\n\nConstant names have also been updated with appropriate unit suffixes, such as THZ,\nGHZ etc.\n\nAdditionally, it also updates capacity unit conversion logic and ensures more\nconsistent construction of TAPI model objects across SRG, DEGREE, and XPONDER\ncases.\n```",

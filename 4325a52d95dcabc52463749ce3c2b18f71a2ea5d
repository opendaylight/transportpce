      "message": "Hi Jonas. Had a discussion with Shweta. She confirmed that with existing code availableSrgCp is never going to be empty. So your proposal fully make sense. However, when moving to flex grid, we need to start checking at CP ports to see spectrum availability rather than only looking at pp ports. Thus we would suggest to use (this.availableSrgPp.isEmpty() || this.availableSrgCp.isEmpty()) rather than just (this.availableSrgPp.isEmpty())\nThanks",

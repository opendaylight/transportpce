At the time, I simply converted the 2.2.1 files to 7.1, but without adding all the new configurations that are important. Thus, you could have simply replaced them with a compliant 7.1 configuration instead of introducing a new node...",

All the existing sample configs in 7.1 directory are 2.2.1 ROADMs. I didn\u0027t want to change them to 7.1, since there are other tests that can be using it. So I created a new sample config for 7.1 and instead creating new functional tests, I have simply changed the ROADM model in B100G (end-to-end)",

      "message": "This doesn\u0027t really make sense to me. If NMC width is larger than MC width - guard bands, then the allocated MC width is not large enough and this service is not following the OpenROADM spec. Logically, you should set NMC width to nmcWidthFromMode if it\u0027s a standard mode and to MC width - guard bands if it\u0027s a non-standard mode (\"that does not follow OR specs\" as you say).",

      "message": "Sorry but I don\u0027t get your point. The highest value that NMC width can take here is MaxFreq - MinFreq - 12.5 GHz . So if we consider that the values that are provided at this step are consistent (After path computation and through postAlgoValidator) how would we have a nmc that can exceed the mc (MaxFreq - MinFreq)? \n\nHere we just check if nmc-width calculated through path computation is greater than what would be defined without considering any constraint on the wavelength spacing, so the width defined by the operational mode; and if this is the case, derive the nmc from the mc rather than using what\u0027is defined by the mode.",

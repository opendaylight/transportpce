If NMC width is larger than MC width - guard bands, then the allocated MC width is not large enough and this service is not following the OpenROADM spec. Logically, you should set NMC width to nmcWidthFromMode if it\u0027s a standard mode and to MC width - guard bands if it\u0027s a non-standard mode (\"that does not follow OR specs\" as you say).",

      "message": "Sorry but I don\u0027t get your point. The highest value that NMC width can take here is MaxFreq - MinFreq - 12.5 GHz . So if we consider that the values that are provided at this step are consistent (After path computation and through postAlgoValidator) how would we have a nmc that can exceed the mc (MaxFreq - MinFreq)? \n\nHere we just check if nmc-width calculated through path computation is greater than what would be defined without considering any constraint on the wavelength spacing, so the width defined by the operational mode; and if this is the case, derive the nmc from the mc rather than using what\u0027is defined by the mode.",

      "message": "Ok, got it. Will need to investigate in PostAlgo to see what I did and if I check this case. Basically the constraint expressed through dedicated-signal-bandwidth is  supposed to be used to impose wider frequency slots than what is driven by specs (when needed), not the opposite that would not make sense. Of course this doesn\u0027t mean we should not check that correct values have been set. But this will not be in this class.",

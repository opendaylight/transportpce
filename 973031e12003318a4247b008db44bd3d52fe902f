      "message": "I have a concern with your default setting in case McCapabilities is not filled : In the OR device model, all parameters included in McCapability profile are optional. So this case may happen. \nAs higher rates becomes available on transponders on the market , we may have to handle signal-width of 150, 175 GHz...\nThese transponders might be connected to old generation of OpenROADM ROADMs that use a fixgrid. Or on Flexgrid compliant ROADMs that do not advertise McCapability profiles in the way we expect.\nA fixgrid based on 50GHz doesn\u0027t mean that we can not support signals with a bandwidth that is a multiple of 50 GHz (SuperChannels, 800G channels @ 131 Gbauds...). If we apply this, we won\u0027t be able to have more than 1 slot of 50GHz, and won\u0027t be able to have next gen Xponders over old gen ROADM.\nWould prefer we that we stick to OR spec, setting a maximum value corresponding to 4800 GHz (768).",

      "message": "This sounds strange to me. Are you saying that there are old generations of ROADMs not supporting flexgrid but still supporting superchannels?\nAlso, note that the default max-slots specified in the openroadm device yang is \"1\" so I think it makes sense to use that here.",

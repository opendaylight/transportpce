I would prefer we keep what has been generally done untils now (except few changes from you), wrapping lines with adequat indendatation when necessary.",

      "message": "Fair enough, please can you use a separate change on top of this one reather than a new PS ?\n\nCode readability can be really subjective and I am more worried by the increase of methods arguments, which is the real root cause of code complication here.\nThe style I am pushing here might not be perfect but I see it as a pragmatic compromise to ease developers and maintainers\u0027life by benefiting from Git automatic conflict resolution when cherry-picking and rebasing contributions.\nHope this helps",

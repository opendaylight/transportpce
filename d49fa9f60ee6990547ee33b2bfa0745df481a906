      "message": "Hello Robert, Guillaume,\nI\u0027ve been trying to migrate the TransportPCE master branch to Sulfur for a few days, but I\u0027m running into some weird things that I don\u0027t see happening on other MRI projects that have already been migrated.\nI put my progress on gerrit to allow you, if necessary and could find a few moments for that, to take a look at it.\nWhen locally I overpass the step of compiling models, the compilation fails on our way of using InstanceIdentifier.create(), but I really can\u0027t figure out what can be wrong with what we\u0027ve been doing for a few years and which seems to me in line with what is in the sulfur migration guide (see for example line 111 of /common/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/transportpce/common/mapping/PortMappingVersion121.java \u003d\u003e InstanceIdentifier\u003c Info \u003e infoIID \u003d InstanceIdentifier.create(OrgOpenroadmDevice.class).child(Info.class);)\nThanks in advance for your help.",

      "message": "Thanks so much Joakim for this huge and valuable contribution. \nHope my comments will be understandable since I went back and forth between the different classes many times, as I understood some things only going through the latest tests. So it could be that some of them not fully make sense, reflecting part of y confusion. We can discuss it during next meeting.\nIt\u0027s great and brings a feature of interest for several companies that asked for modifying OR models (service API) to have it. I have only 1 or 2 concerns with the name you choose for some of the parameters :\nThe leaf slot-width, and the way you use width and slot in the name of your variables. In openRoadm when we use \"width\" aside a \"frequency\", it always mean total width, and shall not be multiplied by anything. If I remember well this was one reason for being sometime confused.\nThanks again, and do not spend too much time of comments that do not seem so clear to you : again, we can discuss it in a meeting.",

And if you go for this option, imho width would make more sense and would be in line with what we have in OpenROADM (center-frequency, associated width, which is the total width and shall be m x 12.5 GHz).\nThe description in the yang file is clear. My point was more about the fact that, reading the code, it is confusing until we go back to the yang file to read the description.\nI also understand Jonas point. The fact is that we have to deal with both ITU-T and OpenROADM. Imho, if we find a name that clearly describe the parameter, it will make it clear in the code and clarify potential misunderstandings. Then my preference would be number-of-frequency-slots (frequency-slot let think that we are not talking of unitary slot of 6.25, but that we align on a frequency grid, minimum spacing being 12.5 GHz). Could be freq-slot-multiplier, freq-slot-m. Do not hesitate to make other suggestions if you feel this is still not satisfactory considering ITU-T definitions.",

My original intention was to throw an exception if this case happened. It appears this is no longer the case. Perhaps a refactor gone wrong, I\u0027ll have to check. \n\nImho, a \"hard fail\" would be better, i.e. the client has specified something that doesn\u0027t make any sense.\n\nfrequency-range\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\nIn this case my intention was to use the union. I\u0027ve discussed this with Jonas and he feels the intersection would be better.

      "message": "Nice to see we’re covering lots of naming variants. Over time though, this table might become hard to maintain. Maybe we could simplify it by normalising the input format instead — e.g., convert to uppercase and strip punctuation before lookup?\n\ne.g.\n```java\nMap.of(\n    \"SMF\", FiberType.Smf,\n    \"G652\", FiberType.Smf,\n    \"G653\", FiberType.Dsf,\n    \"G655\", FiberType.NzDsf,\n    \"ELEAF\", FiberType.Eleaf,\n    \"OLEAF\", FiberType.Oleaf,\n    \"TRUEWAVE\", FiberType.Truewave,\n    \"TRUEWAVECLASSIC\", FiberType.Truewavec,\n    \"G654\", FiberType.Ull\n);\n```\n\nThen when resolving the fiber type, we could normalise the input first:\n\n```java\nString normalized \u003d input.trim().toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)\n    .replace(\".\", \"\")\n    .replace(\"-\", \"\");\nFiberType type \u003d FIBER_TYPES_TABLE.get(normalized);```\n\nTo keep things clean, it might also make sense to move the normalization logic into a small helper class or utility method (e.g. FiberTypeNormalizer.normalize(input)), so this logic is reusable and the lookup code stays easy to read.",

      "message": "This class seems to carry a lot of nullable state and behaves more like a data container than a cohesive model.\n\nBecause most fields are optional and mutable, it’s hard to reason about what a valid instance looks like, and client code needs to add lots of defensive null checks. Over time, that could make it difficult to maintain and test.\n\nIt might help to give this class a clearer lifecycle — e.g., define required fields through a constructor or builder, make fields final where possible, and encapsulate any domain logic it’s responsible for.\n\nIn general, if the class represents a specific concept (like a network endpoint), it might make sense for it to own that behavior rather than just expose its internal state.",

      "message": "It looks like this interface mixes OpenROADM and TAPI model types. That makes it easy for an implementer to accidentally combine or confuse data from the two models — for example, `OperationalState` and `AdministrativeState` come from TAPI, while `State` comes from OpenROADM. \n\n```\nimport ...openroadm.common.state.types.rev191129.State;\nimport ...tapi.common.rev221121.AdministrativeState;\nimport ...tapi.common.rev221121.OperationalState;\n```\n\nSince interfaces define a contract, any implementation would be required to handle both models at once — even when the use case would benefit from (or requires) working with only one. It might be worth considering separating these so implementations don’t need to mix both models by contract.\n\nIt would also prevent clients from accidentally mixing information from two different data models.",

      "message": "Hi Roshan, For your information since I saw you started working on the catalog, just so that we avoid duplicating work: I started working on primitives to retrieve parameters from the catalog. I have also modified the json file to populate the catalog, which I did not have the chance to test because we experienced issues with the API doc at the time I built it. There were wrong parameters that made it fail.\nThanks",

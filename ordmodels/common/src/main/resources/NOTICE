This work includes a modified version of the YANG model org-openroadm-port-types
developed by the Open ROADM MSA.

It contains an additional regen identity 'if-OTUCn-ODUCn-regen' found in some
non-compliant devices.
Though this identity should have been advertised through a YANG deviation,
this does not raise any compatibility problem with compliant devices.
This is an ideally temporary work-around until a compliant solution is found.

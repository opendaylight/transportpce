TransportPCE Developer Guide
============================

Overview
--------

TransportPCE describes an application running on top of the OpenDaylight
controller. Its primary function is to control an optical transport
infrastructure using a non-proprietary South Bound Interface (SBI). It may be
interconnected with Controllers of different layers (L2, L3 Controller…), a
higher layer Controller and/or an Orchestrator through non-proprietary
Application Programing Interfaces (APIs). Control includes the capability to
configure the optical equipment, and to provision services according to a
request coming from a higher layer controller and/or an orchestrator.
This capability may rely on the controller only or it may be delegated to
distributed (standardized) protocols.


Architecture
------------

TransportPCE modular architecture is described on the next diagram. Each main
function such as Topology management, Path Calculation Engine (PCE), Service
handler, Renderer \_responsible for the path configuration through optical
equipment\_ and Optical Line Management (OLM) is associated with a generic block
relying on open models, each of them communicating through published APIs.

   TransportPCE architecture

Fluorine, Neon and Sodium releases of transportPCE are dedicated to the control
of WDM transport infrastructure. The WDM layer is built from colorless ROADMs
and transponders.

The interest of using a controller to provision automatically services strongly
relies on its ability to handle end to end optical services that spans through
the different network domains, potentially equipped with equipment coming from
different suppliers. Thus, interoperability in the optical layer is a key
element to get the benefit of automated control.

Initial design of TransportPCE leverages OpenROADM Multi-Source-Agreement (MSA)
which defines interoperability specifications, consisting of both Optical
interoperability and Yang data models.

End to end OTN services such as OCH-OTU4, structured ODU4 or 10GE-ODU2e
services are supported since Magnesium SR2. OTN support will continue to be
improved in the following releases of Magnesium and Aluminium.

An experimental support of Flexgrid is introduced in Aluminium. Depending on
OpenROADM device models, optical interfaces can be created according to the
initial fixed grid (for R1.2.1, 96 channels regularly spaced of 50 GHz), or to
a flexgrid (for R2.2.1 use of specific number of subsequent frequency slots of
6.25 GHz depending on one side of ROADMs and transponders capabilities and on
the other side of the rate of the channel. The full support of Flexgrid,
including path computation and the creation of B100G (Beyond 100 Gbps) higher
rate interfaces will be added in the following releases of Aluminium.


Module description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ServiceHandler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Service Handler handles request coming from a higher level controller or an orchestrator
through the northbound API, as defined in the Open ROADM service model. Current
implementation addresses the following rpcs: service-create, temp-service-create,
service–delete, temp-service-delete, service-reroute, and service-restoration. It checks the
request consistency and trigs path calculation sending rpcs to the PCE. If a valid path is
returned by the PCE, path configuration is initiated relying on Renderer and OLM. At the
confirmation of a successful service creation, the Service Handler updates the service-
list/temp-service-list in the MD-SAL. For service deletion, the Service Handler relies on the
Renderer and the OLM to delete connections and reset power levels associated with the
service. The service-list is updated following a successful service deletion. In Neon SR0 is
added the support for service from ROADM to ROADM, which brings additional flexibility and
notably allows reserving resources when transponders are not in place at day one.
Magnesium SR2 fully supports end-to-end OTN services which are part of the OTN infrastructure.
It concerns the management of OCH-OTU4 (also part of the optical infrastructure) and structured
HO-ODU4 services. Moreover, once these two kinds of OTN infrastructure service created, it is
possible to manage some LO-ODU services (for the time being, only 10GE-ODU2e services).
The full support of OTN services, including 1GE-ODU0 or 100GE, will be introduced along next
releases (Mg/Al).

PCE
^^^

The Path Computation Element (PCE) is the component responsible for path
calculation. An interface allows the Service Handler or external components such as an
orchestrator to request a path computation and get a response from the PCE
including the computed path(s) in case of success, or errors and indication of
the reason for the failure in case the request cannot be satisfied. Additional
parameters can be provided by the PCE in addition to the computed paths if
requested by the client module. An interface to the Topology Management module
allows keeping PCE aligned with the latest changes in the topology. Information
about current and planned services is available in the MD-SAL data store.

Current implementation of PCE allows finding the shortest path, minimizing either the hop
count (default) or the propagation delay. Central wavelength is assigned considering a fixed
grid of 96 wavelengths 50 GHz spaced. The assignment of wavelengths according to a flexible
grid considering 768 subsequent slots of 6,25 GHz (total spectrum of 4.8 Thz), and their
occupation by existing services is planned for later releases.
In Neon SR0, the PCE calculates the OSNR, on the base of incremental noise specifications
provided in Open ROADM MSA. The support of unidirectional ports is also added.

PCE handles the following constraints as hard constraints:

-   **Node exclusion**
-   **SRLG exclusion**
-   **Maximum latency**

In Magnesium SR0, the interconnection of the PCE with GNPY (Gaussian Noise Python), an
open-source library developed in the scope of the Telecom Infra Project for building route
planning and optimizing performance in optical mesh networks, is fully supported.

If the OSNR calculated by the PCE is too close to the limit defined in OpenROADM
specifications, the PCE forwards through a REST interface to GNPY external tool the topology
and the pre-computed path translated in routing constraints. GNPy calculates a set of Quality of
Transmission metrics for this path using its own library which includes models for OpenROADM.
The result is sent back to the PCE. If the path is validated, the PCE sends back a response to
the service handler. In case of invalidation of the path by GNPY, the PCE sends a new request to
GNPY, including only the constraints expressed in the path-computation-request initiated by the
Service Handler. GNPy then tries to calculate a path based on these relaxed constraints. The result
of the path computation is provided to the PCE which translates the path according to the topology
handled in transportPCE and forwards the results to the Service Handler.

GNPy relies on SNR and takes into account the linear and non-linear impairments
to check feasibility. In the related tests, GNPy module runs externally in a
docker and the communication with T-PCE is ensured via HTTPs.

Topology Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Topology management module builds the Topology according to the Network model
defined in OpenROADM. The topology is aligned with IETF I2RS RFC8345 model.
It includes several network layers:

-  **CLLI layer corresponds to the locations that host equipment**
-  **Network layer corresponds to a first level of disaggregation where we
   separate Xponders (transponder, muxponders or switchponders) from ROADMs**
-  **Topology layer introduces a second level of disaggregation where ROADMs
   Add/Drop modules ("SRGs") are separated from the degrees which includes line
   amplifiers and WSS that switch wavelengths from one to another degree**
-  **OTN layer introduced in Magnesium includes transponders as well as switch-ponders and
   mux-ponders having the ability to switch OTN containers from client to line cards. Mg SR0
   release includes creation of the switching pool (used to model cross-connect matrices),
   tributary-ports and tributary-slots at the initial connection of NETCONF devices.
   The population of OTN links (OTU4 and ODU4), and the adjustment of the tributary ports/slots
   pool occupancy when OTN services are created is supported since Magnesium SR2.**


Renderer
^^^^^^^^

The Renderer module, on request coming from the Service Handler through a service-
implementation-request /service delete rpc, sets/deletes the path corresponding to a specific
service between A and Z ends. The path description provided by the service-handler to the
renderer is based on abstracted resources (nodes, links and termination-points), as provided
by the PCE module. The renderer converts this path-description in a path topology based on
device resources (circuit-packs, ports,…).

The conversion from abstracted resources to device resources is performed relying on the
portmapping module which maintains the connections between these different resource types.
Portmapping module also allows to keep the topology independant from the devices releases.
In Neon (SR0), portmapping module has been enriched to support both openroadm 1.2.1 and 2.2.1
device models. The full support of openroadm 2.2.1 device models (both in the topology management
and the rendering function) has been added in Neon SR1. In Magnesium, portmapping is enriched with
the supported-interface-capability, OTN supporting-interfaces, and switching-pools (reflecting
cross-connection capabilities of OTN switch-ponders).

After the path is provided, the renderer first checks what are the existing interfaces on the
ports of the different nodes that the path crosses. It then creates missing interfaces. After all
needed interfaces have been created it sets the connections required in the nodes and
notifies the Service Handler on the status of the path creation. Path is created in 2 steps
(from A to Z and Z to A). In case the path between A and Z could not be fully created, a
rollback function is called to set the equipment on the path back to their initial configuration
(as they were before invoking the Renderer).

Magnesium brings the support of OTN services. SR0 supports the creation of OTU4, ODU4, ODU2/ODU2e
and ODU0 interfaces. The creation of these low-order otn interfaces must be triggered through
otn-service-path RPC. Magnesium SR2 fully supports end-to-end otn service implementation into devices
(service-implementation-request /service delete rpc, topology alignement after the service has been created).


OLM
^^^

Optical Line Management module implements two main features: it is responsible
for setting up the optical power levels on the different interfaces, and is in
charge of adjusting these settings across the life of the optical
infrastructure.

After the different connections have been established in the ROADMS, between 2
Degrees for an express path, or between a SRG and a Degree for an Add or Drop
path; meaning the devices have set WSS and all other required elements to
provide path continuity, power setting are provided as attributes of these
connections. This allows the device to set all complementary elements such as
VOAs, to guaranty that the signal is launched at a correct power level
(in accordance to the specifications) in the fiber span. This also applies
to X-Ponders, as their output power must comply with the specifications defined
for the Add/Drop ports (SRG) of the ROADM. OLM has the responsibility of
calculating the right power settings, sending it to the device, and check the
PM retrieved from the device to verify that the setting was correctly applied
and the configuration was successfully completed.


Inventory
^^^^^^^^^

TransportPCE Inventory module is responsible to keep track of devices connected in an external MariaDB database.
Other databases may be used as long as they comply with SQL and are compatible with OpenDaylight (for example MySQL).
At present, the module supports extracting and persisting inventory of devices OpenROADM MSA version 1.2.1.
Inventory module changes to support newer device models (2.2.1, etc) and other models (network, service, etc)
will be progressively included.

The inventory module can be activated by the associated karaf feature (odl-transporpce-inventory)
The database properties are supplied in the “opendaylight-release” and “opendaylight-snapshots” profiles.
Below is the settings.xml with properties included in the distribution.
The module can be rebuild from sources with different parameters.

Sample entry in settings.xml to declare an external inventory database:
::

    <profiles>
      <profile>
          <id>opendaylight-release</id>
    [..]
         <properties>
                 <transportpce.db.host><<hostname>>:3306</transportpce.db.host>
                 <transportpce.db.database><<databasename>></transportpce.db.database>
                 <transportpce.db.username><<username>></transportpce.db.username>
                 <transportpce.db.password><<password>></transportpce.db.password>
                 <karaf.localFeature>odl-transportpce-inventory</karaf.localFeature>
         </properties>
    </profile>
    [..]
    <profile>
          <id>opendaylight-snapshots</id>
    [..]
         <properties>
                 <transportpce.db.host><<hostname>>:3306</transportpce.db.host>
                 <transportpce.db.database><<databasename>></transportpce.db.database>
                 <transportpce.db.username><<username>></transportpce.db.username>
                 <transportpce.db.password><<password>></transportpce.db.password>
                 <karaf.localFeature>odl-transportpce-inventory</karaf.localFeature>
         </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>


Once the project built and when karaf is started, the cfg file is generated in etc folder with the corresponding
properties supplied in settings.xml. When devices with OpenROADM 1.2.1 device model are mounted, the device listener in
the inventory module loads several device attributes to various tables as per the supplied database.
The database structure details can be retrieved from the file tests/inventory/initdb.sql inside project sources.
Installation scripts and a docker file are also provided.

Key APIs and Interfaces

Running transportPCE project
----------------------------

To use transportPCE controller, the first step is to connect the controller to optical nodes
through the NETCONF connector.

.. note::

    In the current version, only optical equipment compliant with open ROADM datamodels are managed
    by transportPCE.


Connecting nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect a node, use the following JSON RPC

**REST API** : *POST /restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/topology-netconf/node/<node-id>*

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
        "node": [
            {
                "node-id": "<node-id>",
                "netconf-node-topology:tcp-only": "false",
                "netconf-node-topology:reconnect-on-changed-schema": "false",
                "netconf-node-topology:host": "<node-ip-address>",
                "netconf-node-topology:default-request-timeout-millis": "120000",
                "netconf-node-topology:max-connection-attempts": "0",
                "netconf-node-topology:sleep-factor": "1.5",
                "netconf-node-topology:actor-response-wait-time": "5",
                "netconf-node-topology:concurrent-rpc-limit": "0",
                "netconf-node-topology:between-attempts-timeout-millis": "2000",
                "netconf-node-topology:port": "<netconf-port>",
                "netconf-node-topology:connection-timeout-millis": "20000",
                "netconf-node-topology:username": "<node-username>",
                "netconf-node-topology:password": "<node-password>",
                "netconf-node-topology:keepalive-delay": "300"
            }
        ]
    }


Then check that the netconf session has been correctly established between the controller and the
node. the status of **netconf-node-topology:connection-status** must be **connected**

**REST API** : *GET /restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/topology-netconf/node/<node-id>*


Node configuration discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the controller is connected to the node, transportPCE application automatically launchs a
discovery of the node configuration datastore and creates **Logical Connection Points** to any
physical ports related to transmission. All *circuit-packs* inside the node configuration are
analyzed.

Use the following JSON RPC to check that function internally named *portMapping*.

**REST API** : *GET /restconf/config/portmapping:network*

.. note::

    In ``org-openroadm-device.yang``, four types of optical nodes can be managed:
        * rdm: ROADM device (optical switch)
        * xpdr: Xponder device (device that converts client to optical channel interface)
        * ila: in line amplifier (optical amplifier)
        * extplug: external pluggable (an optical pluggable that can be inserted in an external unit such as a router)

    TransportPCE currently supports rdm and xpdr

Depending on the kind of open ROADM device connected, different kind of *Logical Connection Points*
should appear, if the node configuration is not empty:

-  DEG<degree-number>-TTP-<port-direction>: created on the line port of a degree on a rdm equipment
-  SRG<srg-number>-PP<port-number>: created on the client port of a srg on a rdm equipment
-  XPDR<number>-CLIENT<port-number>: created on the client port of a xpdr equipment
-  XPDR<number>-NETWORK<port-number>: created on the line port of a xpdr equipment

    For further details on openROADM device models, see `openROADM MSA white paper <https://0201.nccdn.net/1_2/000/000/134/c50/Open-ROADM-MSA-release-2-Device-White-paper-v1-1.pdf>`__.

Optical Network topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before creating an optical connectivity service, your topology must contain at least two xpdr
devices connected to two different rdm devices. Normally, the *openroadm-topology* is automatically
created by transportPCE. Nevertheless, depending on the configuration inside optical nodes, this
topology can be partial. Check that link of type *ROADMtoROADM* exists between two adjacent rdm
nodes.

**REST API** : *GET /restconf/config/ietf-network:network/openroadm-topology*

If it is not the case, you need to manually complement the topology with *ROADMtoROADM* link using
the following REST RPC:


**REST API** : *POST /restconf/operations/networkutils:init-roadm-nodes*

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
      "networkutils:input": {
        "networkutils:rdm-a-node": "<node-id-A>",
        "networkutils:deg-a-num": "<degree-A-number>",
        "networkutils:termination-point-a": "<Logical-Connection-Point>",
        "networkutils:rdm-z-node": "<node-id-Z>",
        "networkutils:deg-z-num": "<degree-Z-number>",
        "networkutils:termination-point-z": "<Logical-Connection-Point>"
      }
    }

*<Logical-Connection-Point> comes from the portMapping function*.

Unidirectional links between xpdr and rdm nodes must be created manually. To that end use the two
following REST RPCs:

From xpdr to rdm:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**REST API** : *POST /restconf/operations/networkutils:init-xpdr-rdm-links*

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
      "networkutils:input": {
        "networkutils:links-input": {
          "networkutils:xpdr-node": "<xpdr-node-id>",
          "networkutils:xpdr-num": "1",
          "networkutils:network-num": "<xpdr-network-port-number>",
          "networkutils:rdm-node": "<rdm-node-id>",
          "networkutils:srg-num": "<srg-number>",
          "networkutils:termination-point-num": "<Logical-Connection-Point>"
        }
      }
    }

From rdm to xpdr:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**REST API** : *POST /restconf/operations/networkutils:init-rdm-xpdr-links*

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
      "networkutils:input": {
        "networkutils:links-input": {
          "networkutils:xpdr-node": "<xpdr-node-id>",
          "networkutils:xpdr-num": "1",
          "networkutils:network-num": "<xpdr-network-port-number>",
          "networkutils:rdm-node": "<rdm-node-id>",
          "networkutils:srg-num": "<srg-number>",
          "networkutils:termination-point-num": "<Logical-Connection-Point>"
        }
      }
    }

OTN topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before creating an OTN service, your topology must contain at least two xpdr devices of MUXPDR
or SWITCH type connected to two different rdm devices. To check that these xpdr are present in the
OTN topology, use the following command on the REST API :

**REST API** : *GET /restconf/config/ietf-network:network/otn-topology*

An optical connectivity service shall have been created in a first setp. Since Magnesium SR2, the OTN
links are automatically populated in the topology after the Och, OTU4 and ODU4 interfaces have
been created on the two network ports of the xpdr.

Creating a service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the *service handler* module to create any end-to-end connectivity service on an OpenROADM
network. Two kind of end-to-end "optical" services are managed by TransportPCE:
- 100GE service from client port to client port of two transponders (TPDR)
- Optical Channel (OC) service from client add/drop port (PP port of SRG) to client add/drop port of
two ROADMs.

For these services, TransportPCE automatically invokes *renderer* module to create all required
interfaces and cross-connection on each device supporting the service.
As an example, the creation of a 100GE service implies among other things, the creation of OCH, OTU4
and ODU4 interfaces on the Network port of TPDR devices.

Since Magnesium SR2, the *service handler* module directly manages some end-to-end otn
connectivity services.
Before creating a low-order OTN service (1GE or 10GE services terminating on client port of MUXPDR
or SWITCH), the user must ensure that a high-order ODU4 container exists and has previously been
configured (it means structured to support low-order otn services) to support low-order OTN containers.
Thus, OTN service creation implies three steps:
1. OCH-OTU4 service from network port to network port of two OTN Xponders (MUXPDR or SWITCH)
2. HO-ODU4 service from network port to network port of two OTN Xponders (MUXPDR or SWITCH)
3. 10GE service creation from client port to client port of two OTN Xponders (MUXPDR or SWITCH)

The management of other OTN services (1GE-ODU0, 100GE...) is planned for future releases.


100GE service creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following REST RPC to invoke *service handler* module in order to create a bidirectional
end-to-end optical connectivity service between two xpdr over an optical network composed of rdm
nodes.

**REST API** : *POST /restconf/operations/org-openroadm-service:service-create*

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
        "input": {
            "sdnc-request-header": {
                "request-id": "request-1",
                "rpc-action": "service-create",
                "request-system-id": "appname"
            },
            "service-name": "test1",
            "common-id": "commonId",

As for the previous RPC, this RPC invokes the *PCE* module to compute a path over the
*otn-topology* that must contains ODU4 links with valid bandwidth parameters, and then
invokes *renderer* and *OLM* to implement the end-to-end path into the devices.


.. note::
    Since Magnesium SR2, the service-list corresponding to OCH-OTU4, ODU4 or again 10GE-ODU2e services is
    updated in the service-list datastore.

.. note::
    trib-slot is used when the equipment supports contiguous trib-slot allocation (supported from
    Magnesium SR0). The trib-slot provided corresponds to the first of the used trib-slots.
    complex-trib-slots will be used when the equipment does not support contiguous trib-slot
    allocation. In this case a list of the different trib-slots to be used shall be provided.
    The support for non contiguous trib-slot allocation is planned for later Magnesium release.

Deleting a service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deleting any kind of service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following REST RPC to invoke *service handler* module in order to delete a given optical
connectivity service.

**REST API** : *POST /restconf/operations/org-openroadm-service:service-delete*

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
        "input": {
            "sdnc-request-header": {
                "request-id": "request-1",
                "rpc-action": "service-delete",
                "request-system-id": "appname",
                "notification-url": "http://localhost:8585/NotificationServer/notify"
            },
            "service-delete-req-info": {
                "service-name": "something",
                "tail-retention": "no"
            }
        }
    }

Most important parameters for this REST RPC is the *service-name*.


.. note::
    Deleting OTN services implies proceeding in the reverse way to their creation. Thus, OTN
    service deletion must respect the three following steps:
    1. delete first all 10GE services supported over any ODU4 to be deleted
    2. delete ODU4
    3. delete OCH-OTU4 supporting the just deleted ODU4

Invoking PCE module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following REST RPCs to invoke *PCE* module in order to check connectivity between xponder
nodes and the availability of a supporting optical connectivity between the network-ports of the
nodes.

---------------------

This feature allows TransportPCE application to expose at its northbound interface other APIs than
those defined by the OpenROADM MSA. With this feature, TransportPCE provides part of the Transport-API
specified by the Open Networking Foundation. More specifically, part of the Topology Service component
is implemented, allowing to expose to higher level applications an abstraction of its OpenROADM
topologies in the form of topologies respecting the T-API modelling. The current version of TransportPCE
implements the *tapi-topology.yang* model in the revision 2018-12-10 (T-API v2.1.2).

As in IETF or OpenROADM topologies, T-API topologies are composed of lists of nodes and links that
abstract a set of network resources. T-API specifies the *T0 - Multi-layer topology* which is, as
indicated by its name, a single topology that collapses network logical abstraction for all network
layers. Thus, an OpenROADM device as, for example, an OTN xponder that manages the following network
layers ETH, ODU, OTU, Optical wavelength, will be represented in T-API T0 topology by two nodes:
one *DSR/ODU* node and one *Photonic Media* node. Each of them are linked together through one or
several *transitional links* depending on the number of network/line ports on the device.

Aluminium SR2 comes with a complete refactoring of this module, handling the same way multi-layer
abstraction of any Xponder terminal device, whether it is a 100G transponder, an OTN muxponder or
again an OTN switch. For all these devices, the implementation manages the fact that only relevant
ports must appear in the resulting TAPI topology abstraction. In other words, only client/network ports
that are undirectly/directly connected to the ROADM infrastructure are considered for the abstraction.
Moreover, the whole ROADM infrastructure of the network is also abstracted towards a single photonic
node. Therefore, a pair of unidirectional xponder-output/xponder-input links present in *openroadm-topology*
is represented by a bidirectional *OMS* link in TAPI topology.
In the same way, a pair of unidirectional OTN links (OTU4, ODU4) present in *otn-topology* is also
represented by a bidirectional OTN link in TAPI topology, while retaining their available bandwidth
characteristics.

Two kinds of topologies are currently implemented. The first one is the *"T0 - Multi-layer topology"*
defined in the reference implementation of T-API. This topology gives an abstraction from data coming
from openroadm-topology and otn-topology. Such topology may be rather complex since most of devices are
represented through several nodes and links.
Another topology, named *"Transponder 100GE"*, is also implemented. That latter provides a higher level
of abstraction, much simpler, for the specific case of 100GE transponder, in the form of a single
DSR node.

The figure below shows an example of TAPI abstractions as performed by TransportPCE starting from Aluminium SR2.

   :alt: Example of T0-multi-layer TAPI abstraction in TransportPCE

In this specific case, as far as the "A" side is concerned, we connect TransportPCE to two xponder
terminal devices at the netconf level :
- XPDR-A1 is a 100GE transponder and is represented by XPDR-A1-XPDR1 node in *otn-topology*
- SPDR-SA1 is an otn xponder that actually contains in its device configuration datastore two otn
xponder nodes (the otn muxponder 10GE=>100G SPDR-SA1-XPDR1 and the otn switch 4x100GE => 4x100G SPDR-SA1-XPDR2)
As represented on the bottom part of the figure, only one network port of XPDR-A1-XPDR1 is connected
to the ROADM infrastructure, and only one network port of the otn muxponder is also attached to the
ROADM infrastructure.
Such network configuration will result in the TAPI *T0 - Multi-layer topology* abstraction as
represented in the center of the figure. Let's notice that the otn switch (SPDR-SA1-XPDR2), not
being attached to the ROADM infrastructure, is not abstracted.
Moreover, 100GE transponder being connected, the TAPI *Transponder 100GE* topology will result in a
single layer DSR node with only the two Owned Node Edge Ports representing the two 100GE client ports
of respectively XPDR-A1-XPDR1 and XPDR-C1-XPDR1...


**REST API** : *POST /restconf/operations/tapi-topology:get-topology-details*

This request builds the TAPI *T0 - Multi-layer topology* abstraction with regard to the current
state of *openroadm-topology* and *otn-topology* topologies stored in OpenDaylight datastores.

**Sample JSON Data**

.. code:: json

    {
      "tapi-topology:input": {
        "tapi-topology:topology-id-or-name": "T0 - Multi-layer topology"
       }
    }

This request builds the TAPI *Transponder 100GE* abstraction with regard to the current state of
*openroadm-topology* and *otn-topology* topologies stored in OpenDaylight datastores.
Its main interest is to simply and directly retrieve 100GE client ports of 100G Transponders that may
be connected together, through a point-to-point 100GE service running over a wavelength.

.. code:: json

    {
      "tapi-topology:input": {
        "tapi-topology:topology-id-or-name": "Transponder 100GE"
        }
    }


.. note::

    As for the *T0 multi-layer* topology, only 100GE client port whose their associated 100G line
    port is connected to Add/Drop nodes of the ROADM infrastructure are retrieved in order to
    abstract only relevant information.

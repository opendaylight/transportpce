      "message": "I think that lines 73-76 order is not coherent.\nIn my opion, portmapping should be put before pce_400G for 2 reasons:\n- this is what is done in 1.2.1 tests\n- pce_400G does not require any sims. Thus sims installation should precede portmapping tests.\n\nAlso, I think it was fine to put this new tests before E2E tests at line 62.",

/**
 * <p>
 *     Device transaction manager manages access to netconf devices. Only one transaction can be opened per device so
 *     it IS IMPORTANT TO CLOSE TRANSACTION as soon as transactions is not needed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Most important method is {@link DeviceTransactionManager#getDeviceTransaction(String)}. This method let's you
 *     obtain {@link DeviceTransaction} on the device. {@link DeviceTransaction} provices methods to read/write data
 *     from/to device.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Method
 *  {@link DeviceTransactionManager#getDataFromDevice(String, LogicalDatastoreType, InstanceIdentifier, long, TimeUnit)}
 *     is 'shortcut' to get data from device. It creates {@link DeviceTransaction}, gets data via it and then closes
 *     the transaction.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Two timeouts are built in process to prevent locking device forever:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *     First is from creation of {@link DeviceTransaction} to calling method to close it (commit or cancel). When using
 *     {@link DeviceTransactionManager#getDeviceTransaction(String)} method then default timeout will be used. If there
 *     is need to specify this timeout manually use
 *     {@link DeviceTransactionManager#getDeviceTransaction(String, long, TimeUnit)} method. So if programmer will
 *     forgot to close transaction or it will take too much time transaction will be cancelled automatically and device
 *     will be unlocked.
 *     </li>
 *
 *     <li>
 *     Second timeout is from calling {@link DeviceTransaction#commit(long, TimeUnit)} until commit is completed on
 *     device. Timeout can be specified directly using commit method. So in case commit will freeze somewhere on device
 *     or it will take too much time device will be unlocked.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *     If there is only need to read from device
 *  {@link DeviceTransactionManager#getDataFromDevice(String, LogicalDatastoreType, InstanceIdentifier, long, TimeUnit)}
 *     method can be used. It will automatically take care of {@link DeviceTransaction} and it will return data.
 *     This method <b>SHOULD NOT BE USED TOGETHER WITH DEVICE TRANSACTION ON THE SAME DEVICE IN THE SAME TIME</b>.
 *     In case that {@link DeviceTransaction} is created on device and before committing it
 *  {@link DeviceTransactionManager#getDataFromDevice(String, LogicalDatastoreType, InstanceIdentifier, long, TimeUnit)}
 *     method is called then get method will wait (will be blocking current thread) until device will be unlocked.
 *     However device is locked by transaction previously created. So this will result in blocking current thread until
 *     timeout for commit transaction will run out and cancel transaction. This can lead to incorrect execution of code.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Bellow is simple example how to get {@link DeviceTransaction}, put some data to it and then commit it.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     // get device transaction future from device transaction manager
 *     Future<Optional<DeviceTransaction>> deviceTxFuture = deviceTransactionManager.getDeviceTransaction(deviceId);
 *     DeviceTransaction deviceTx;
 *     try {
 *         // wait until device transaction is available
 *         Optional<DeviceTransaction> deviceTxOpt = deviceTxFuture.get();
 *
 *         // check if device transaction is present
 *         if (deviceTxOpt.isPresent()) {
 *             deviceTx = deviceTxOpt.get();
 *         } else {
 *             throw new IllegalStateException("Device transaction for device " + deviceId + " was not found!");
 *         }
 *     } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
 *         throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to obtain device transaction for device " + deviceId + "!", e);
 *     }
 *
 *     // do some operations with transaction
 *     deviceTx.put(LogicalDatastoreType.CONFIGURATION, someInstanceIdentifier, someData);
 *     deviceTx.delete(LogicalDatastoreType.CONFIGURATION, someOtherInstanceIdentifier, someOtherData);
 *
 *     // commit transaction with 5 seconds timeout
 *     FluentFuture<? extends @NonNull CommitInfo> commit = deviceTx.commit(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 *     try {
 *         // wait until transaction is committed
 *         commit.get();
 *     } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
 *         throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to post data to device " + deviceId + "!", e);
 *     }
 * }

      "message": "Some Python tests are failing. I think the reason is that with this change, all links with the deleted node as source or dest node are deleted, i.e. including e.g. ROADM to ROADM links and ROADM to XDPR links. I had forgotten about this but when we introduced this change in our version of TPCE, we thought this was a good thing and saw it as an added bonus. But it is a change in behaviour that everybody may not agree with so I\u0027d like to hear others opinion on this.",

For ROADM to ROADM, this may not be an serious issue since they are discovered automatically, even if I have a clear preference on keeping them. For XPDR to ROADM, operational guys are not supposed to recreate manually the links, using the dedicated RPC, after a node has temporarly vanished from the Data store whatever is the reason for this.\n\nIn your proposal, you change radically the behaviour of this class. The links stored in the TopologyShard only concerns Non-Disagregated Node(UnderlayNode) internal links: this means Add/drop and express links for ROADMS. If tests are impacted with regards to RDMtoRDM and RDM to XPDR link this means the link you target for deletion in your proposal are links of the topology which should not be affected since they are not part of the topologyShard.",

      "message": "Ok, now I understand your concern about deleting non-internal links. As I see it, the main problem is that a node may be unintentionally deleted from the openroadm topology (temporarily vanish as you say) just because e.g. the netconf connection goes down. Then it is of course annoying if links disappear. This is another thing we have changed in our version so that a node is only deleted from openroadm datastores when explicitly requested. In this case I think it make sense to delete all links since the node does not exist anymore. Do you agree?\n\nI will not make any further updates to this change. If you are interested, maybe I will submit a separate change proposal related to not automatically deleting nodes from openroadm datastores when they disappear from netconf topology, as discussed above.",

      "message": "Some Python tests are failing. I think the reason is that with this change, all links with the deleted node as source or dest node are deleted, i.e. including e.g. ROADM to ROADM links and ROADM to XDPR links. I had forgotten about this but when we introduced this change in our version of TPCE, we thought this was a good thing and saw it as an added bonus. But it is a change in behaviour that everybody may not agree with so I\u0027d like to hear others opinion on this.",

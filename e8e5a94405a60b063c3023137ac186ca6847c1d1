      "message": "Can you elaborate? I am a bit lost, since original comment was made in a separate change. You changed the yang file so that the slot-width parameter is expressed as a width in GHZ. But at the end the java method slotWidth still returns an integer. Not sure that your approach really clarify things, if we consider that original comment (if I remember well made by you or Jonas) was made on the java code and was concerning this slotWidth.",

      "message": "Well, regardless of the API input, I\u0027m faced with a situation where I need to translate the API input to a number of 6.25GHz \u0027slots\u0027 or perhaps \u0027bits\u0027 if you will, i.e. the number of slots/bits in a bit array of 768 bits (where each bit represent a width of 6.25GHz). Internally an individual bit in TPCE is sometimes referred to as \"index\".\n\nSo it doesn\u0027t really matter that much if the API input is an integer or GHz. Either of them needs to be translated into a number of 6.25 GHz \u0027slots\u0027 in a 768 bit array. \n\nSo previously, if slot-width \u003d 1, this method would return 2 (i.e. 1 x 12.5GHz slot \u003d 2 x 6.25GHz slots).\nNow, if slot-width \u003d 12.5, this method still returns 2.\n\nAssuming `frequencyGranularity \u003d 6.25`, of course. Anyway, I hope I was able to make it somewhat clearer what I was trying to do.",

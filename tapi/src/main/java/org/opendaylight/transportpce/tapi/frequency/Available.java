/**
 * A class capable of representing available frequency slots as a bit map may implement
 * this interface.
 *
 * <p>Available frequency ranges are represented by a (signed) byte array.
 * The size of the byte array multiplied by byte size is equal to the
 * total number of frequency "slots".
 * e.g. 96 bytes = 768 bits = 768 frequency slots.
 *
 * <p>Each frequency range is assumed to be 1 signed byte, i.e. 8 bits where
 * each bit represents a frequency range with a width of e.g. 6.25 GHz.
 *
 * <p>Examples:
 * byte[] frequencies = {0}       => {0b00000000} (no frequency slots available)
 * byte[] frequencies = {1}       => {0b00000001}
 * byte[] frequencies = {56}      => {0b00111000}
 * byte[] frequencies = {127}     => {0b01111111}
 * byte[] frequencies = {-128}    => {0b10000000}
 * byte[] frequencies = {-1}      => {0b11111111} (all frequency slots available)
 * byte[] frequencies = {-58}     => {0b11000110}
 * byte[] frequencies = {-58, -1} => {0b11000110, 0b11111111}
 *
 * <p>The available frequency slots...
 *     byte[] frequencies = {-58, -1} => {0b11000110, 0b11111111}
 * ...can be reversed using the method assignedFrequencies():
 *     availableFrequencies() => {0b00111001, 0b00000000}
